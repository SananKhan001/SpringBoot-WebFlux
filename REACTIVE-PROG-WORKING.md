# Reactive Programming in Detail

```
In traditional blocking programming models, when a thread receives a request, it processes the 
request and waits for the processing to complete before it can handle another request. This 
approach can be inefficient because the thread is often idle while waiting for I/O operations (like 
database queries or network calls) to complete.
```

#### In contrast, reactive programming employs a non-blocking, asynchronous approach. Here's how it works:

- Event Loop : 

```
There is typically an event loop that continuously listens for new events 
(e.g., incoming requests).
```
- Asynchronous Handling : 

```
When a request comes in, the event loop assigns it to a handler. 
This handler processes the request up to the point where it needs 
to perform an I/O operation (e.g., fetch data from a database).
```

- Callback/Promise/Future : 

```
Instead of waiting for the I/O operation to complete, the handler
sets up a callback, promise, or future that will be triggered 
when the I/O operation completes.
```

- Release the Thread : 

```
The handler then releases the thread back to the event loop,
allowing it to handle other incoming requests.
```

- Completion Handling : 

```
When the I/O operation completes, the callback/promise/future 
is triggered, and the remaining processing for the request is 
performed, often by the same or another available thread.
```

#### Benefits
- Scalability : 

```
Because threads are not blocked waiting for I/O operations, they
can handle more requests simultaneously.
```

- Resource Efficiency : 

```
Fewer threads are required to handle the same number of requests, 
reducing memory and context-switching overhead.
```
- Responsiveness: 

```
The system can respond to new requests more quickly because threads
are freed up promptly after initiating I/O operations.
